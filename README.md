# Complete-Machine-Learning-Practicals

Heyy Everyone **Kishan Mishra** this side . Hope you guys are doing extremely well .

Almost everything coming out of the technology world these days seems to have an element of artificial intelligence or machine learning (ML) in it. ML today is the implementation of some aspects of human abilities but certainly not the entire potential for human intelligence. ML enables people to accomplish more by collaborating with smart software. It is like putting more human face to technology. The whole world is debating the consequence of AI/ML and how it will impact our future. 

So here is a repository consisting, all the Machine Learning algorithm's practical implementations.

Keep Learning !
