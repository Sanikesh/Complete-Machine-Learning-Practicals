# Complete-Machine-Learning-Practicals

Heyy Everyone **Sanikesh Mohanty** this side . Hope you guys are doing extremely well .

Almost everything coming out of the technology world these days seems to have an element of artificial intelligence or machine learning (ML) in it. ML today is the implementation of some aspects of human abilities but certainly not the entire potential for human intelligence.
